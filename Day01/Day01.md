## 🧠 Topic 1: How the Internet Works

### 🌐 Brief History: Web 1.0 → Web 3.0

#### Web 1.0 (1990s – early 2000s) – The "Read-Only" Web
- Static websites with no interactivity
- Built using HTML and CSS (no JavaScript)
- Users could only read content
- No user engagement, social media, or real-time interactions
- **Example:** Early Yahoo! pages, simple blogs

#### Web 2.0 (2004 – Present) – The "Read-Write" Web
- Dynamic and interactive experiences
- Technologies like AJAX and JavaScript for live updates
- Rise of social media, e-commerce, cloud apps
- Users generate content: comments, blogs, chats
- **Example:** Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Amazon

#### Web 3.0 (Emerging) – The "Decentralized" Web
- Blockchain-based and AI-driven
- Focus on privacy and user data control
- **Example:** Cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, Ethereum, Filecoin

### 🧩 Basics of Computer Communication & Data Transmission

#### 📦 Data Transmission & Packets
- Internet transmits data in **packets**
- Each packet includes:
  - **Header** (source & destination info)
  - **Payload** (the actual data)
- Uses **TCP/IP protocols**

#### 📡 Two Types of Communication
- **Wired:** Ethernet, Fiber Optics – fast and stable
- **Wireless:** Wi-Fi, 5G – flexible but may be slower

---

### 🌍 Domain Names, IP Addresses, MAC Addresses, and Routing

#### 🌐 IP Address
- Unique identifier for internet-connected devices
- **IPv4:** xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (4.3 billion addresses)
- **IPv6:** Provides a larger space

#### 🆔 MAC Address
- Unique ID for a device’s network adapter
- **Example:** 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
- Used in **local networks**

#### 🌐 Domain Names
- Human-readable URLs (e.g., www.google.com)
- Resolved to IP addresses via **DNS (Domain Name System)**

#### 🔁 Routing
- Routers/gateways direct packets efficiently
- Packets may take different routes to reach destination

---

### 🏢 Overview of ISP & DNS Functionality

#### 🌐 Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- Companies like **Jio, Airtel, BSNL**
- Provide access to the internet

#### 🔍 How DNS Works
1. User types a domain (e.g., www.google.com)
2. Browser contacts DNS server
3. DNS resolves the name to an IP (e.g., 142.250.183.206)
4. Browser uses IP to reach the website

---

## 🖥️ Topic 2: Client-Server Architecture

### 🧑‍💻 Introduction to Client-Server Model

#### What is a **Client**?
- Device that requests data from a server
- **Examples:** Web browsers, mobile apps

#### What is a **Server**?
- Powerful machine providing services or content
- **Examples:** Web, API, and database servers

> **Analogy:** Client is like a restaurant customer, Server is like the waiter

---

### 🔁 Differences Between Client and Server

#### Example:
- You visit YouTube → client sends request
- YouTube server responds with videos

---

### 🔄 HTTP Request/Response Cycle

#### ⚙️ How It Works
1. Client sends request (e.g., `GET /index.html`)
2. Server processes and sends response
3. Client displays data

#### 📬 HTTP Methods
- `GET`: Retrieve data
- `POST`: Send data (forms, login)
- `PUT`: Update existing data
- `DELETE`: Remove data

> **Example:** You (client) order pizza (GET), kitchen (server) prepares and serves it

---

### 🧑‍🎨 Frontend vs Backend, Static vs Dynamic Websites

#### Frontend (Client-side)
- Runs in browser
- **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

#### Backend (Server-side)
- Runs on server
- **Tech:** Node.js, PHP, Python

#### Static vs Dynamic
- **Static:** Like a printed book
- **Dynamic:** Like a news site with updates

---

### 🌐 Basics of Web Hosting

- Web hosting stores your site for access online
- **Types:** Shared, VPS, Cloud Hosting
- **Providers:** GoDaddy, Hostinger, AWS, Netlify

> **Analogy:** Hosting = renting an apartment for your website
