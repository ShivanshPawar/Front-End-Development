# 📘 Day 09 – Creating a Responsive Website with SCSS

Welcome to Day 9! Today was all about putting our CSS and SCSS skills to work by **building a real website** that’s clean, responsive, and modular. We got our hands dirty by combining layout structure with mobile-first design and SCSS best practices.

### 🎨 Writing Modular SCSS
We didn’t just write plain CSS. We made our styling smarter using **SCSS**, with tools like:
- `@import` to split files (partials like `_variables.scss`, `_buttons.scss`)
- `$variables` for consistent colors and spacing
- `@mixin` and `@include` for reusable code blocks

Example:
```scss
@mixin flex-center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
